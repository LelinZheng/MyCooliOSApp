### My App Idea:

**Pet Feeding Tracker**
Description:
An app that helps pet owners track their pets' feeding schedules. Users can set daily feeding times, track when their pet was last fed, and share updates with family members or pet sitters. Features could include notifications for feeding times, a "last fed" history log, and multiple pet profiles for households with more than one animal. Pet's health information could be also tracked including weight and activities on a daily basis.


## Notes

Renaming the app involved many steps and I needed to carefully update the project name, folder structure, Info.plist paths, and GitHub remote settings. It was challenging to make sure that all the internal references stayed consistent so that the app could build and run successfully without breaking existing connections or version control.
